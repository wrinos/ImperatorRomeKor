lex_papia|0=Lex Papia de Peregrinis
lex_papia_desc|0=This law set out to challenge false claims of citizenship, with the ultimate aim of deporting foreigners from Rome. Archias, the mentor of Cicero, was famously tried under this law, an act which caused Cicero to write his work, 'Pro Archia Poeta', in Archias' defense.
lex_licinia|0=Lex Licinia Mucia
lex_licinia_desc|1=This law instigated the investigation of Italian allies registered as Roman citizens, largely due to a populist trend in xenophobia. The passing of the act caused uproar amongst the Roman Allies, effectively banning them from acting as citizens.

marian_reforms|0=Marian Reforms
marian_reforms_desc|0=The Marian reforms drastically overhauled the organization and recruitment policies of the Roman republic.

senatus_consultum_ultimum_desc|0=Intended to safeguard the republic in times of desperate need, the 'Final Decree of the Senate', was a reform of the older system of dictatorship, whereby one man would receive absolute authority over matters of state.

republican_land_reform_4|0=Land Seizure Amendments
republican_land_reform_4_desc|0=The extreme measures of the Land Seizure Protocol may not be quite as necessary as previously thought. By reaching a compromise with the nobility, they will grudgingly provide support, whilst retaining control over their own affairs.
