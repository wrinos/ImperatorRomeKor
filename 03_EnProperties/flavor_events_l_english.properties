natural_disaster_events.1.d|0=While the fires of Mount Aetna never sleeps fully the eruption of [GetDateString] has been greater than any in living memory.\nFor 3 days the skies over Catania has been black, with a plume of ash clouds and lightening covering the skies.

flavor_sel.1.t|0=The Eastern Satrapies
flavor_sel.1.desc|0=Decades ago Alexander invaded India and extended his empire to the Indus, but the many wars between the successor kings have left these Eastern Satrapies isolated and weak.\nIn the past year Chandragupta Maurya has united northern India, crushing the Nanda Empire, while sweeping in over the Greek Satraps in the Indus Valley.\nIt has been suggested that we should cut our losses, and give up the last of the Eastern Satrapies to the Mauryas, or this conflict could drag out for years. A truce would also buy us the time we need to consolidate our own empire and defeat the other successors.
flavor_sel.1.a|0=Let us negotiate with the Mauryas.
flavor_sel.1.b|0=We will offer them no such thing!

flavor_sel.2.t|0=And End To The Greek Menace?
flavor_sel.2.desc|0=Decades ago Alexander the great invaded our subcontinent and defeated the local rulers of the Indus valley. Many things have changed since then however. The death of the great conqueror has seen his empire divided among squabbling successors and the meteoric rise of Chandragupta Maurya has transformed northern India.\nIn the past year Mauryan armies have seized the Indus Valley and are advancing on the positions of the successor king Seleucus.\nAn emissary from Seleucus, is now offering to give this region up, in return for a treaty of friendship with our empire.

flavor_sel.4.a|0=Fantastic!
flavor_sel.5.t|0=An Uneasy Truce
flavor_sel.5.desc|0=The Mauryas have agreed to a truce. This would allow both of our states some much needed respite. Time for rebuilding and for consolidation of our young empire.\nWhile this would mean turning our back on the Greek cities in the Indus valley for now it may be the most prudent course of action.
flavor_sel.5.a|0=Time to turn our attention to Antigonus!
flavor_sel.5.b|0=To the Indus!
flavor_sel.6.t|0=War!
flavor_sel.6.desc|0=Rather than send a formal reply the Mauryas have sent us the head of our messenger.\nOur border garrisons are reporting Mauryan troops scouting their positions, war is now inevitable.

flavor_arm.1.t|0=The Cappadocian Throne
flavor_arm.1.desc|0=Years ago the Macedonian general Eumenes took over the kingdom of Cappadocia from its native dynast, the Persian Satrap Ariarathes I. Since that time Ariarathes heir and nephew, also named Ariarathes, has been in our custody.\nEumenes has since died and left Cappadocia to Antigonus of Phrygia, who has placed the region under the control of the Macedonian Satrap Amyntas. Amyntas now stands alone and forgotten as Antigonus battle the other successor kingdoms in Egypt and Mesopotamia.\n\nHas the time come to send Ariarathes back to Cappadocia?
flavor_arm.1.a|0=An excellent idea!

flavor_arm.2.t|0=Return of the King
flavor_arm.2.desc|0=Word has reached us that the heir of old king Ariarathes, Ariarathes II, is marching on our capital, with support fromt he nearby kingdom of Armenia.\nFar from his native land, Amyntas has never been a popular ruler of Cappadocia. While we may rely on the support of our Macedonian nobles it is likely that any native Cappadocians will take these news very badly.
flavor_arm.2.a|0=Long live Ariarathes II!
flavor_arm.2.b|0=We must arrest this impostor.
flavor_egy.1.t|0=The Cult of Serapis
flavor_egy.1.desc|0=As rulers of a foreign people we have not always been embraced with open arms. The Egyptian clergy in particular harbor a deep resentment to our Hellenic gods. The Serapis cult, mixes a number of elements of Hellenistic and Egyptian religion into a new syncretic faith. By promoting this cult in our state we could perhaps bridge the gap between the Macedonian settlers and the Egyptian populace. By promoting this small cult to the faith of our kingdom we might also shape it and use it for the benefit of the Lagid dynasty.

flavor_epi.1.desc|0=The political situation has evolved quickly since the start of the Diadochi conflicts. Every state in the Hellenic world is deciding who to support, and hoping that they will have backed the right horse.\n\nFor our own part, it has been suggested that King Pyrrhus' sister Deidamia, previously betrothed to Alexander the Great's late son, would make a good match with Demetrius, son of Antigonus and heir to the Phrygian kingdom.\n\nThe Antigonids could be just the friends we need...

flavor_epi.2.desc|0=The political situation has evolved quickly since the start of the Diadochi conflicts. Every state in the Hellenic world is deciding who to support, and hoping that they will have backed the right horse.\n\nThe kingdom of Epirus is strategically placed to be a thorn in Macedonia's side, and king Pyrrhus' surely has an axe to grind with Cassander, whose armies slew his father.\n\nThe marriage of Pyrrhus' sister Deidamia, once betrothed to the late son of Alexander the Great, to Demetrius, heir to our kingdom, has been suggested for some months. The Epirotes could be just the friends we need...

flavor_epi.4.desc|0=The accursed Phrygians have decided to back out of the long planned marriage of Demetrius Antigonid and Deidamia Aeacidae, citing the political upheaval as a cause for uncertainty.\n\nWe had banked on their support in the inevitable conflicts to come.

dhe_carthage.1.t|0=The Barcas
dhe_carthage.1.desc|0=While the Barca family has been a force in Carthaginian politics for a long time few have made a name for themselves in the same way as Hamilcar Barca. After a number of successful enterprises in our widespread empire this man has returned to build an empire for him and his kin. While some eyebrows have been raised in response to Hamilcar's request to bring an army into Hispania his actions could without a doubt expand our influence in the region. He promises to bring in new settlers as well as secure our access to the many resources of the peninsula.\n\nAccompanying Hamilcar is his sons and daughters, some would say that his actions are as much to build a power base for his family as it is to promote the influence of our city.
dhe_carthage.1.a|0=Such a promising line...
dhe_carthage.1.b|0=We cannot allow a man to gain such power!
dhe_parthians.1.t|0=Arsaces
dhe_parthians.1.desc|0=With the unification of the Dahae tribes great social changes are also upon us. Some men thrive in such conditions, rising from obscurity to relevance and power.\nArsaces is one such man. Having quickly built a power base for himself, with enthusiastic warriors joining his side by the hundreds, he has now approached the Clan Chiefs offering his assistance in bringing our federation towards a brighter future.
dhe_parthians.1.a|0=The world will never be the same.
