 dhe_bactria.1.t:0 "Greco-Bactrian Relations"
 dhe_bactria.1.desc:0 "The Macedonian mayor of [SCOPE.sP('country_province').GetName], [SCOPE.sP('country_province').GetState.GetName], has sent us a messenger asking for help in assimilating some of those living in the city. Not only would he like us to teach some of the locals in the city about our culture, but he also wants us to send more people to [SCOPE.sP('country_province').GetName] so they could go forward as an example to the others.\n\nAs the local Bactrians and our own people have had certain issues coming to terms with one another, it would probably lead to conflicts and disagreements if we choose not to do anything about the issue."
 dhe_bactria.1.a:0 "We will send some of our men to help him out."
 dhe_bactria.1.b:0 "They will probably work it out, without our aid."
 dhe_bactria.1.tt:0 "Up to #Y 20%#! of the #Y non-Hellenic#! population of #Y [THIS.GetProvince.GetName]#! will become #Y Macedonian#!."
 dhe_bactria.2.t:0 "A Bactrian for Bactria"
 dhe_bactria.2.desc:0 "Though the Greeks ruled Bactria for a while, now it is under the auspicious leadership of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], a man of Bactrian origin and Greek education. With a leader that can be accepted by both of the groups, it might be time to explore the origins of our culture and region.\n\nWe have been a satrapy under the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander, Antigonus and Seleucus, it is time for us to find our own path without an overlord."
 dhe_bactria.2.a:0 "Yes, it is time for a change."
 dhe_bactria.2.a.tt:0 "Up to #Y 33%#! of the population in #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('original_country').GetCapital.GetName]#! will become #Y Bactrian. #!"
 dhe_bactria.2.b:0 "Looking into our past seems like an interesting proposition."
 dhe_bactria.2.c:0 "And yet our [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_base_government_type')] will always be Greek."
 dhe_bactria.2.c.tt:0 "Up to #Y 33%#! of the population in #Y [SCOPE.sCountry('original_country').GetCapital.GetName]#! will become #Y Macedonian. #!\nWe will stop looking into our Bactrian origins."
 dhe_bactria.3.t:0 "Rise of Diodotus"
 dhe_bactria.3.desc:0 "A minor noble named Diodotus has become the talk of the [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('get_base_government_type')] lately, as he seems to take part in everything important that has happened. Be it civic matters, military or otherwise, he has played an important role in making everything turn out for the better.\n\nIt did not take long until he was invited to our court, to play a more direct role in our government."
 dhe_bactria.3.a:0 "Interesting fellow, is he not?"
 dhe_bactria.4.t:0 "Rise of Diodotus"
 dhe_bactria.4.desc:0 "Diodotus has surpassed everyones expectations and turned into one of the most popular nobles at court, and it did not take long for the people to start talking about him as a potential heir to Bactria. From whispers at first, the demands grew ever more significant as time passed.\n\nRecently [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has started talking about retiring from public life, and people are talking about Diodotus' claims to leadership."
 dhe_bactria.4.a:0 "Time for a change."
 dhe_bactria.4.b:0 "No, we need [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."
