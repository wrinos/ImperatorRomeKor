The enemy flee in disgrace, and all that is left, is to decide on how to treat the residents within.\n\nNeedless to say, the spoils of war are likely to cause those back in [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetEmployer.GetCapital.GetName] to admire [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetPraenomen] greatly, but leaving such wealth in the hands of one [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetWomanMan] could cause problems in future..."

The wealth that [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen] has gained from this evil act is beyond compare, and our advisors suggest that [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetSheHe] is now one of the richest people in our land. Even deserters previously resident in [SCOPE.sP('temp_city_scope_warfare_1').GetName] are flocking to join [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetPraenomen].\n\nDespite [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHis] popular acclaim, we should consider punishing [SCOPE.sChar('siege_instigator').GetHerHim] for these dastardly actions."
